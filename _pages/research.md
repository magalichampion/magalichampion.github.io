Assistant Professor in Statistics, MAP5, IUT Paris-Rives de Seine, Université Paris Cité

#### Responsabilities

- Associate editor of the [International Journal of Biostatistics](https://www.degruyter.com/journal/key/ijb/html)


#### Research interests

- Statistical learning
   - high-dimensional statistics
   - graphical models
   - penalized linear regressions
   - sparse methods
   - clustering
- Computational biology
   - gene regulatory network inference
   - applications to medical research 
   - multi-omics data integration
   
#### Current projects

- In collaboration with Mathilde Pacault (Centre Hospitalier Régionale Universitaire, Brest), Camille Verebi (Hôpital Cochin, Paris) and Juliette Nectoux (Hôpital Cochin, Paris), we are working on Sequential Probability Ratio Tests with applications to Non-Invasive Prenatal Diagnosis (NIPD). 

- In collaboration with Camille Champion (INRAE Jouy-en-Josas), I am also interested in regularized spectral clustering techniques for clustering large perturbed graphs. We are now working on applications of the l1-spectral clustering algorithm we developped on kidney cancer data.

#### Supervision of students
