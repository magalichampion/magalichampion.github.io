Assistant Professor in Statistics, MAP5, IUT Paris-Rives de Seine, Université Paris Cité

Guest researcher, Seminar for Statistics, ETH Zürich

#### Responsabilities

- Associate editor of the [International Journal of Biostatistics](https://www.degruyter.com/journal/key/ijb/html)
- Co-organizer of the statistics seminar of MAP5, with Jonathan El Methni


#### Research interests

- Statistical learning
   - high-dimensional statistics
   - graphical models
   - multi-linear regressions
   - sparse methods
   - clustering
- Computational biology
   - gene regulatory network inference
   - applications to medical research 
   - multi-omics data integration
   
#### Current projects

- In collaboration with Mathilde Pacault (Centre Hospitalier Régionale Universitaire, Brest), Camille Verebi (Hôpital Cochin, Paris), Romain Daveau (AP-HP) Juliette Nectoux (Hôpital Cochin, Paris), we are working on Sequential Probability Ratio Tests with applications to Non-Invasive Prenatal Diagnosis (NIPD). 

- In collaboration with Camille Champion, I am also interested in sparse robust spectral clustering techniques for clustering large perturbed graphs. We are now working on applications of the l1-spectral clustering algorithm we developped on kidney cancer data.
