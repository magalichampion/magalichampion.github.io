I am an assistant professor in Statistics at the department STID of IUT Paris-Rives de Seine, Université Paris Cité and a member of the [MAP5](https://map5.mi.parisdescartes.fr/) lab. I spent the first seven months of 2022 as a guest researcher at the [Seminar for Statistics](https://math.ethz.ch/sfs) lab from ETH Zürich.

Before that, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the MAP5, where I was part of a biomedical project. I also spent one year as a postdoctoral researcher at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research (BMIR). I completed my PhD in December 2014 from Université Toulouse III under the supervision of Sébastien Gadat, Christine Cierco-Ayrolles and Matthieu Vignes.
