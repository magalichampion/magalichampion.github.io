I am an assistant professor in Statistics at the Data Science (SD) department of IUT Paris-Rives de Seine, Université Paris Cité and a member of the [MAP5](https://map5.mi.parisdescartes.fr/) lab. I am specialized in the development of machine learning methods for high-dimensional data. I work on biomedical projects in collaborations with clinicians.

About me: before joining the MAP5, I spent one year as a postdoctoral researcher at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research (BMIR). I completed my PhD in December 2014 from Université Toulouse III under the supervision of Sébastien Gadat, Christine Cierco-Ayrolles and Matthieu Vignes.
